# AdventOfCode

Repo for Advent of Code 2021 that I am using as coding practice and trying out some new languages and techniques I haven't used a whole lot. 

My name is Jonathan McNeil, I am a software engineer with most of my expierence in the C#/.NET/Windows world at a large global engineering company.  I am currently seeing employment that will allow me to work in Singapore where I currently am visiting my beautiful fiance.  I very much emjoy puzzles, and want to expand my current knowledge as I look for jobs. 

Feel free to show me how to do things in better, cleaner or faster ways. This solely exists for me (and I guess potentially you) to learn! ðŸ˜¸.  

Rules:

    1. Please do not provide me with solutions to problems I haven't yet tried. I really am interested in improvments/bug fixes to the solutions I've completed.
    
    2. Be kind. I am trying out things that I haven't done before or haven't looked at in a few years. 
    
    3. Have fun and Merry Christmas! ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…
